The maf folder should contain maf formatted files generated by multiz. To
generate these maf alignments denovo, see this link for multiz description and
miller lab software:

http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=cons100way

and see this link for the precomputed maf files I've used:

https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/multiz100way/maf/

The maf folder should contain one maf file per chromosome, and the chromosome
names, genome, and coordinates of the reference genome must match those from
the bed file.
